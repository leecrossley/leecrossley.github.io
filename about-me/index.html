<h2 id="Who_am_I?">Who am I?</h2>
<p>I’m a full stack developer and general level-headed guy, who gets the job done right and on time.</p>
<p>For the past few years my skills have extended to mobile development and I’ve been using <a href="http://phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a> in anger since the early days.</p>
<p>Contributing to open source projects (including my own) is something I find very rewarding, as well as entering the odd hack competition.</p>
<p>In addition to all things dev, I love to write, record and play live music.</p>

<p>Well, the domain was just one I had hanging around (although only since Jan 2012 a quick lookup tells me).</p>
<p>The main reason for the blog is to give my skype contacts and <a href="https://twitter.com/lee_crossley">twitter followers</a> a break from my rants and ramblings. I also occasionally come up with something useful.</p>

<p>I’m currently the technical director at <a href="http://www.clickinnovate.com">Click Innovate</a>.</p>
