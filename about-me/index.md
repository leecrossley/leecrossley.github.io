## Who am I?

I'm a full stack developer and general level-headed guy, who gets the job done right and on time.

For the past few years my skills have extended to mobile development and I've been using [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) in anger since the early days.

Contributing to open source projects (including my own) is something I find very rewarding, as well as entering the odd hack competition.

In addition to all things dev, I love to write, record and play live music.

## Why iLee.co.uk?
Well, the domain was just one I had hanging around (although only since Jan 2012 a quick lookup tells me).

The main reason for the blog is to give my skype contacts and [twitter followers](https://twitter.com/lee_crossley) a break from my rants and ramblings. I also occasionally come up with something useful.

## Where do I work?
I'm currently the technical director at [Click Innovate](http://www.clickinnovate.com).
