    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>The world is turning flat</h2>
<p>Print designers that design for the web are stepping close to the edge.</p>
<p><img src="/img/flat-world.png" alt="The world is flat"></p>
<h2>This blog</h2>
<p>I&#39;m not a designer (this is where anyone that has worked with me recently will try to wind me up). <strong>I&#39;m not a designer</strong>, but this blog looks OK, right? It&#39;s simple, no shadows, no gradients and no interface images (at all, the icons are a font). 99% of the time, that&#39;s what users want, something that&#39;s easy to use and understand. It loads quickly too, but that&#39;s a discussion for another day.</p>
<h2>The &quot;Flat UI&quot; / &quot;Metro&quot; era</h2>
<p>Companies and organisations have started to publish their own design guidelines and principles, with a very common theme. Less is more. Here are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples">GOV UK design principles</a> makes it clear that they are be building simple and informative digital services, not websites.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://developer.windowsphone.com/en-us/design/principles">Windows Phone design principles</a> outlines their philosophy as clean, uncluttered screens that operate quickly.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/TransitionGuide/index.html">iOS 7 UI Transition Guide</a> (Apple login required) emphasises that the UI should helps users understand and interact with the content and never compete with it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By now you&#39;ve probably realised I&#39;m not just talking about the web, I&#39;m talking about mobile apps too.</p>
<h2>But what about colours?</h2>
<p><strong>Science my friend</strong>. There are tons of colour scheme generators <a href="http://colorschemedesigner.com/">here</a> and <a href="https://kuler.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/">here</a>, if you&#39;re too lazy to <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=colour+scheme+generators">Google it</a>. Or you can use the colour scheme from <a href="http://flatuicolors.com/">Flat UI</a>, which this blog uses. You don&#39;t need to worry about gradient colours or shadow colours and depth (sorry if that&#39;s the wrong terminology, <strong>I&#39;m not a designer</strong> remember).</p>
<h2>Good developers</h2>
<p>A good developer that&#39;s worth their salt should be able to source any required digital assets, generate a colour scheme and produce a series of quick prototypes. The prototype layouts should be iterated based on real user feedback, not from endless design meetings about what people might want something to look like, which produces pointless psds or pdfs.</p>
<h2>Where does this leave print designers?</h2>
<p>People still print brochures and leaflets (for some reason). Icon fonts and vector based images are even more important than ever and this is something that print designers should be comfortable in producing if they want to design for the web or even apps.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>You may not have noticed but static HTML is taking back the web</h2>
<p>We all thought the days of static HTML websites were long gone when almighty server-side content management systems developed. With their powerful  architecture and databases, often requiring licence fees and a few dedicated GB of RAM on your web server, why wouldn&#39;t bigger be better? It turns out it&#39;s not.</p>
<h2><em>We</em> got it wrong</h2>
<ul>
<li>Static HTML files are fast, no need for in-memory caching.</li>
<li>Static HTML files are secure, there&#39;s much less to try to hack.</li>
<li>Static HTML files <strong>JUST WORK</strong> on virtually any hosting environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>OK, so what are we supposed to do, go back to coding like it&#39;s 1995? Managing common HTML between pages, sitemaps and &quot;last updated&quot; dates manually? Forgetting about new shiny technology like SASS and LESS, JADE and HAML? Not quite. </p>
<h2>Enter the Static Site Generator</h2>
<p>A Static Site Generator is a program which generates and outputs static HTML. The idea is that all the hard work is done upfront, so the user doesn&#39;t have to do the waiting. Think of it as <em>extreme caching</em> :)</p>
<p>Many generators already exist for personal sites, blogs and reference sites etc, and are available for pretty much every language/platform you can imagine. You don&#39;t have to use one off the shelf, they&#39;re pretty easy to put together (hence there being quite a few). It&#39;s also easy to get it working exactly how is best for you and your specific project.</p>
<p>I wrote a bespoke static site generator for a client earlier this year, which ingested a source atom feed and translated the data to HTML5 and RDFa using C# (wasn&#39;t my language of choice but I was constrained by internal politics, I was just happy to get the static site generator approved).</p>
<h2>This blog</h2>
<p>As a final point, this blog is static HTML. It&#39;s hosted for free on <a href="https://github.com/leecrossley/leecrossley.github.io">github</a> pages, with a custom domain name. I&#39;m writing markdown right now and using node.js to generate the HTML and CSS. Hopefully you didn&#39;t notice the page loading.</p>
