        <h2>Get more twitter retweets and favourites</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.tweetthen.com/" target="_blank">TweetThen</a> allows you to calculate the optimal day and time for you to tweet, based on retweets and favourites your tweets have had in the past.</p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>Visit <a href="http://www.tweetthen.com/" target="_blank">TweetThen</a> and authorise the website to access your twitter account. <strong>That&#39;s it!</strong> You&#39;ll automatically be displayed a punch card style chart showing you the days and times when your past tweets were favourited or retweeted (note that it uses the time of your original tweet).</p>
<h2>Why should I bother?</h2>
<p>Whether you&#39;re an individual or a company, you tweet because you want people to read it and engage with it. If you have an important tweet, you want to get the maximum possible exposure.</p>
<p>Twitter is global and users/followers are from various timezones, so your optimal post time may not be what you think. Also, everyones followers are different, TweetThen tailors your date and times directly to your twitter account.</p>
<h2>Is this a unique idea?</h2>
<p>I‘ve found a couple of others doing similar things. One service is free but doesn’t work - at all, and the other costs $4.99 per request! <strong>TweetThen is currently 100% free.</strong></p>
<h2>Who wrote it?</h2>
<p>If you‘ve not guessed by now, it’s a little pet project I started yesterday. It&#39;s built using <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">node.js</a> and uses my <a href="https://github.com/leecrossley/functional-js" target="_blank">functional.js library</a>. I wanted to explore some real world usages of functional.js and also get to grips with the twitter v1.1 API.</p>
<h2>Alpha?</h2>
<p>It‘s is a first iteration prototype and therefore may not perform as intended and issues are possible. I hope to have a beta release soon with an improved assessment algorithm. I’m a strong believer in always developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) initially, for fast and quantitative market testing. </p>
<p>If you have any suggestions or improvements, just drop me a tweet but make sure you use TweetThen first, so you know when&#39;s best to do it :)</p>

        <h2>What is Hack Manchester?</h2>
<p>It‘s a 24 hour coding competition located in Manchester that started in 2012. This year (as it was last year) it’s held at the <a href="http://www.mosi.org.uk/" target="_blank">Museum of Science and Industry</a> and is on the 26th and 27th of October 2013 to kick off 2013&#39;s <a href="http://www.manchestersciencefestival.com/" target="_blank">Manchester Science Festival</a>. Props to <a href="https://twitter.com/ruby_gem" target="_blank">@ruby_gem</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/theallseeingpie" target="_blank">@theallseeingpie</a> for their hard work in organising such a great coding event.</p>
<h2>Hackathons</h2>
<p>Getting top developers working and collaborating together on innovative web and/or mobile apps is always going to produce great results, make it into a competition and the results are even better :). I used to contract at NICE in Manchester where they‘d have hack days for the dev team within the organisation to drive forward creativity and new ideas. It’s a fantastic way to work and there should be more of them.</p>
<h2>Winning in 2012</h2>
<p>If you know me, I‘ve probably mentioned once or twice (more?) about winning the 2012 Thoughtworks Hack Manchester challenge. My team developed an interactive “What’s On” app for the Museum of Science and Industry. The app had interactive map animations, the ability to find your current location within any of the museums buildings and showcased Google Calendar powered events. Users of the app were able to find events occurring at locations around the museum and create a personal “day planner”. There&#39;s a <a href="http://vimeo.com/52477912" target="_blank">video here</a> if you&#39;re interested.</p>
<h2>The team is back</h2>
<p>I&#39;m not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_Back...#Bring_Back...The_A-Team" target="_blank">Justin Lee Collins</a> but I&#39;ve brought the team back together. <a href="https://twitter.com/lee_crossley" target="_blank">Myself</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/edhiley" target="_blank">@edhiley</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ryansroberts" target="_blank">@ryansroberts</a> have thrown some preliminary ideas in the pot and we&#39;re waiting for all the sponsor APIs to be announced.</p>
<h2>Lessons learnt</h2>
<p>We learnt some things from last year that I&#39;m happy to share with you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Idea planning.</strong> Don&#39;t do any <em>coding</em> before the day (it‘s against the rules) but having some ideas of what you’re going to code and reading any documentation before hand will save you time (and fighting) on the day.</li>
<li><strong>Have your tool chain / dev environment ready.</strong> Last year <em>one of our team members</em> tried to download xcode right at the start of the coding session.</li>
<li><strong>Be realistic about what you&#39;re building.</strong> Time flies, it‘ll be 4am before you know it and you don’t want to add extra stress to the caffeine + no sleep equation. Make sure you&#39;re realistic about what you can achieve, review this constantly and have contingency plans.</li>
<li><strong>Know the sponsors.</strong> If you‘re using a sponsors API, it’s crucial that you have a relationship with them if you‘re going to need help. It’ll save you time and they‘ll be excited to see what you’re doing.</li>
<li><strong>Have breaks and enjoy it.</strong> We found that coming back to things after a short break made us more productive. Fortunately the nice guys at Hack Manchester organise food and snacks etc for you. It‘s your free time, take the time to meet other people and find out what they’re up to. I always meet great people at hack events.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tickets</h2>
<p>Tickets for Hack Manchester 2013 went <a href="http://hackmanchester.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">on sale yesterday</a> and were selling pretty fast. I scooped up 3 tickets for my team, if you missed your chance to get yours there will be other opportunities, so I suggest following <a href="https://twitter.com/HackManchester" target="_blank">@HackManchester</a> on twitter to find out when the next wave will be released.</p>
<h2>Shhhh</h2>
<p>I‘ll probably not be discussing any preliminary hack ideas here, but I like Guinness and if you’re around Manchester…</p>

        <h2>The new iPhone fingerprint recognition API</h2>
<p>As a mobile app developer, I follow new mobile technologies very closely. You&#39;ve probably noticed yourself an abundance of rumours on various sites about the upcoming “Fingerprint Recognition” seen in the new beta version of iOS7. This suggests the hardware capabilities will be available on the next version of the iPhone (iPhone 5S?).</p>
<p>The “BiometricKitUI” directory can be found in the “Accessibility Bundles” and judging by the small amount of documentation, implies that the fingerprint sensor will be part of the home button.</p>
<p><img src="/img/fingerprint-iphone.png" alt="Fingerprint scanning on iPhone"></p>
<h2>Will it be available to app developers?</h2>
<p>This is what I want to know :) I can see several usages for the core system, such as a login alternative to swipe and pin, verification for app store purchases, parental control, restricted apps and maybe even user profiles, although apple have always seemed to push for everyone having their own device for some reason ;).</p>
<h2>When will we know?</h2>
<p>I‘m sure app developers at the top banks know, with this being a possible security option for them. I’m going to ask some of my tweeps today and will post an update when I find out.</p>
<p>It&#39;s strongly believed that the new iPhone will be available on the 10th of September 2013, I also imagine the iOS7 release to be scheduled for around this time, as in past years.</p>
<h2>Will it be any good?</h2>
<p>I‘ve had laptops (a while ago) with fingerprint recognition, which was quickly disabled. I’ve found it to be unreliable and a nuisance. Will Apple‘s implementation and hardware be better? Having just acquired “AuthenTec” for $356 million in July 2012 you’d like to hope so. If not, I‘m sure they’ll tell us we&#39;re “holding it wrong” :)</p>
<h2>“i”Lee, is this blog going to be Apple-y?</h2>
<p>No. Not at all (actually being serious here). Although MacBook Pros are the best. Please don&#39;t give them fingerprint recognition.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/multiple-function-composition/">Multiple Function Composition</a></h1>
  

    </header>
    <div class="entry">
      
        <h2>“Function Composition” sounds complicated, what is it?</h2>
<p>It&#39;s actually simple to explain and hopefully understand. (Multiple) function composition is the generation of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function" target="_blank">high-order function</a> by combining simpler functions. It&#39;s probably easier explained using an example.</p>
<h3>Basic example using <a href="https://github.com/leecrossley/functional-js" target="_blank">functional.js</a> to combine two functions</h3>
<figure class="highlight lang-javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">var</span> f = <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="params">(a)</span> {</span>
    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="string">"hello "</span> + a;
};
<span class="keyword">var</span> g = <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="params">(a)</span> {</span>
    <span class="keyword">return</span> a + <span class="number">1</span>;
};
<span class="keyword">var</span> composed = λ.compose(f, g);

expect(composed(<span class="number">1</span>)).toEqual(<span class="string">"hello 2"</span>);
</pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>As you can see, the output from the right-most function is passed as the argument to the next function on the left, you&#39;re then returned “hello 2” as a single result. Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/ryansroberts" target="_blank">@ryansroberts</a> for this one.</p>
<h3>Example using <a href="https://github.com/leecrossley/functional-js" target="_blank">functional.js</a> to combine three functions</h3>
<figure class="highlight lang-javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">var</span> e = <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="params">(a)</span> {</span>
    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="string">"hello "</span> + a;
};
<span class="keyword">var</span> f = <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="params">(a)</span> {</span>
    <span class="keyword">return</span> a + <span class="number">1</span>;
};
<span class="keyword">var</span> g = <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="params">(a)</span> {</span>
    <span class="keyword">return</span> a * <span class="number">100</span>;
};
<span class="keyword">var</span> composed = λ.compose(e, f, g);

expect(composed(<span class="number">2</span>)).toEqual(<span class="string">"hello 201"</span>);
</pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>This example illustrates the combining of multiple functions, passing the output from function “g” as a parameter to function “f”, then passing the output from function “f” as a parameter to function “e”. This leaves you with a single returned result, in this case “hello 201”.</p>
<h2>Ah ha! This is just inheritance for JavaScript</h2>
<p>Haha, no :) it&#39;s not a function <em>inheriting</em> properties from another function, it&#39;s a function <em>composed</em> of other functions. I suggest you look up <a href="http://javascript.crockford.com/prototypal.html" target="_blank">prototypal inheritance</a>. Sometimes it&#39;s ok to link to Crockford.</p>
<h2>What&#39;s the benefit?</h2>
<p>Other than making you look clever, composing functions improves code maintainability and function reuse. I believe that by using high-order functions and point-free programming, it makes your JavaScript much easier to read too. It‘s the future, things move on… you’re not still using VB6 are you (can safely assume that if you&#39;re reading this).</p>
<h2>functional.js (λ)</h2>
<p>It‘s coming on, and expect more function-level programming support soon. Don’t be shy to contribute and note that I‘m currently using 4 soft spaces for tabs, don’t make me go all Crockford on you.</p>

        <h2>functional.js (λ)</h2>
<p>functional.js is (go on, guess) a functional JavaScript library I&#39;m writing. It facilitates <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying" target="_blank">currying</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_programming" target="_blank">point-free / tacit</a> programming in JavaScript.</p>
<p>The library already has support for some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_programming" target="_blank">higher-order programming</a>, such as iterating, mapping and reducing (some examples pulled from my <a href="http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/" target="_blank">jasmine</a> tests are below).</p>
<p>I&#39;m working to add more functions and helpers to support <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function-level_programming" target="_blank">functional-level programming</a> but it&#39;s pretty tough ;). <a href="https://github.com/leecrossley/functional-js" target="_blank">Contributions</a> are more than welcome if you fancy some brain pain.</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>I like <del>torture</del> to push myself as a developer.</p>
<h2>Great, but, erm, why?</h2>
<p>By extending functions into chains of functions with fewer arguments (currying), you can fix earlier known values and return a function that only accepts future values. This avoids repetition, a good programming practice, and will assist my high-level function refinement.</p>
<p>Libraries like <a href="http://underscorejs.org/" target="_blank">underscore</a> can‘t be curried in a regular fashion, as the items come before the iterator (e.g. (items, iterator) not (iterator, items)). There’s also no support for functional-level programming. The idea is that functional.js (λ) will be <em>really</em> lightweight and can  be used as an underscore replacement once it&#39;s been developed further. It also has no dependencies.</p>
<h2>Where can I get it?</h2>
<ul>
<li>$ git clone git@github.com:leecrossley/functional-js.git</li>
<li>$ npm install functional.js</li>
<li><a href="http://bit.ly/funcmin" target="_blank">functional.min.js</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>I have issues</h2>
<p>As long as they&#39;re related, you can report them on <a href="https://github.com/leecrossley/functional-js/issues" target="_blank">github</a>.</p>
<h2>Where&#39;s the λ key?</h2>

        <h2>Numbers don&#39;t add up!</h2>
<p><strong>0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes numbers in JavaScript (and other languages) simply don&#39;t appear to add up. <a href="http://codepen.io/leecrossley/pen/DBJcE" target="_blank">Don&#39;t believe me?</a>.</p>

<p>I discovered this in the early days of programming when building a JavaScript calculator, which fortunately is now nowhere to be seen :)</p>
<h2>Floating point numbers</h2>
<p>JavaScript uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point" target="_blank">Floating Point Numbers</a>, which don&#39;t cater for an accurate representations of a decimal. This means that as soon as the variable is interpreted at runtime, a rounding issue is introduced. Computers are faster and more efficient at dealing with computations on binary numbers, which produces the issue with the 17th decimal place.</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p><a href="http://codepen.io/leecrossley/pen/hKmEa" target="_blank">Here&#39;s an example</a> of how I eliminate the rounding issues.</p>
<figure class="highlight lang-javascript"><figcaption><span>0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3 </span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre>1

<span class="keyword">var</span> multiplier = <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="params">(dec)</span> {</span>
  <span class="keyword">var</span> str = dec.toString(),
      match = <span class="regexp">/(?:\.(\d+))?(?:[eE]([+\-]?\d+))?$/</span>.exec(str);
  <span class="keyword">return</span> Math.max(<span class="number">0</span>, (match[<span class="number">1</span>] == <span class="string">'0'</span> ? <span class="number">0</span> : (match[<span class="number">1</span>] || <span class="string">''</span>).length) - (match[<span class="number">2</span>] || <span class="number">0</span>)) * <span class="number">10</span>;
};
 
<span class="keyword">var</span> highestMultiplier = Math.max(multiplier(x), multiplier(y));
 
<span class="keyword">var</span> result = ((x * highestMultiplier) + (y * highestMultiplier)) / highestMultiplier;
 
console.log(result);
</pre></td></tr></table></figure>


<p>Essentially, I‘m calculating the smallest number, which if multiplied by either number I’m adding together individually, would result in an integer. This is achieved by evaluating the number with the most numbers after the decimal point and what that value is. Once I have the multiplier, I use it on both the numbers I&#39;m adding together, then do the addition, then divide by the multiplier to return the numbers back to their original decimal state.</p>
<p>By performing the addition on integers, no rounding issues occur.</p>
<h2>Libraries</h2>
<p>If you&#39;re needing precision with lots of complex calculations, there are JavaScript libraries specifically for this (although some are horrible Java ports). <a href="https://github.com/MikeMcl/bignumber.js/" target="_blank">bignumber.js</a> looks OK and I remember using <a href="http://www.leemon.com/crypto/BigInt.js" target="_blank">bigint.js</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/danielcassidy" target="_blank">@danielcassidy</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/anttears" target="_blank">@anttears</a> back in the day.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/use-google-pagespeed-on-your-site/">Use Google PageSpeed on Your Site</a></h1>
  

    </header>
    <div class="entry">
      
        <h2>Why?</h2>
<p>The short of it - speeding up your website is a great thing to do all round. It improves visitor experience, retention, and conversions. With data mobile browsing becoming increasingly popular, saving those extra few KB to download can make a big difference to your users.</p>
<p>On April 9th 2010 <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.co.uk/2010/04/using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking.html" target="_blank">Google officially announced</a> the inclusion of a new “signal” in their search ranking algorithms. You guessed it, page speed. So it goes without saying that using Google PageSpeed on your site could also improve your search engine rankings.</p>
<h2>It&#39;s free?</h2>
<p>Yes and no, Google are in it for the €€€ in their Irish pocket. The Google PageSpeed <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights" target="_blank">Insights</a> are currently (and I imagine will always be) free, but the Google PageSpeed <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/service" target="_blank">Service</a> is only a limited free trial. Lose <em>wait</em> that way and the pounds are sure to drop off.</p>
<h2>Insights vs Service</h2>
<p>The Insights allow Google to analyse your website and generate suggestions to help make it faster. The PageSpeed score is any number up to 100 (the higher the better, but Google have suggested you should aim for 85 and above). They also colour code suggestions to help you see which changes will give you the highest impact and potentially quick wins (they&#39;re red). Their current suggestions are mainly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eliminate external render-blocking Javascript and CSS</li>
<li>Avoid landing page redirects</li>
<li>Leverage browser caching</li>
<li>Enable compression</li>
<li>Reduce server response time to &lt; 200ms</li>
<li>Minify HTML, CSS and JavaScript</li>
<li>Optimise images</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/img/response-speed.png" alt="200ms Response"></p>
<p>Some of the Insights guidance is (probably intentionally) tough to follow and may also be constrained by the technology or hosting you&#39;re using. Do not fear, Google is here, with their quick and easy, automated service. Alternatively, you could just use a <a href="http://ilee.co.uk/static-site-generators/">Static Site Generator</a> with some sensible hosting. I&#39;ll probably go over some of the more tricky suggestions at a later date.</p>
<h2>Don&#39;t just do it once</h2>
<p>Do it every night if you can - and make sure you‘re always on top. As for PageSpeed Insights, because the web is fast paced and continually evolving, they’re iterative. Just like the main search algorithm, expect the PageSpeed algorithm and suggestions to change frequently.</p>
<h2>This blog</h2>
<p>Bragging time again. This site currently (at the time of writing) has a desktop PageSpeed score of 97/100. That‘s better than Facebook, Twitter, ebay etc and equal to Google’s own score for Google.com. Yey for me.</p>

        <h2>The world is turning flat</h2>
<p>Print designers that design for the web are stepping close to the edge.</p>
<p><img src="/img/flat-world.png" alt="The world is flat"></p>
<h2>This blog</h2>
<p>I&#39;m not a designer (this is where anyone that has worked with me recently will try to wind me up). <strong>I&#39;m not a designer</strong>, but this blog looks OK, right? It‘s simple, no shadows, no gradients and no interface images (at all, the icons are a font). 99% of the time, that’s what users want, something that‘s easy to use and understand. It loads quickly too, but that’s a discussion for another day.</p>
<h2>The “Flat UI” / “Metro” era</h2>
<p>Companies and organisations have started to publish their own design guidelines and principles, with a very common theme. Less is more. Here are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples" target="_blank">GOV UK design principles</a> makes it clear that they are be building simple and informative digital services, not websites.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://developer.windowsphone.com/en-us/design/principles" target="_blank">Windows Phone design principles</a> outlines their philosophy as clean, uncluttered screens that operate quickly.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/TransitionGuide/index.html" target="_blank">iOS 7 UI Transition Guide</a> (Apple login required) emphasises that the UI should helps users understand and interact with the content and never compete with it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By now you‘ve probably realised I’m not just talking about the web, I&#39;m talking about mobile apps too.</p>
<h2>But what about colours?</h2>
<p><strong>Science my friend</strong>. There are tons of colour scheme generators <a href="http://colorschemedesigner.com/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://kuler.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/" target="_blank">here</a>, if you&#39;re too lazy to <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=colour+scheme+generators" target="_blank">Google it</a>. Or you can use the colour scheme from <a href="http://flatuicolors.com/" target="_blank">Flat UI</a>, which this blog uses. You don‘t need to worry about gradient colours or shadow colours and depth (sorry if that’s the wrong terminology, <strong>I&#39;m not a designer</strong> remember).</p>
<h2>Good developers</h2>
<p>A good developer that&#39;s worth their salt should be able to source any required digital assets, generate a colour scheme and produce a series of quick prototypes. The prototype layouts should be iterated based on real user feedback, not from endless design meetings about what people might want something to look like, which produces pointless psds or pdfs.</p>
<h2>Where does this leave print designers?</h2>
<p>People still print brochures and leaflets (for some reason). Icon fonts and vector based images are even more important than ever and this is something that print designers should be comfortable in producing.</p>

        <h2>You may not have noticed but static HTML is taking back the web</h2>
<p>We all thought the days of static HTML websites were long gone when almighty server-side content management systems developed. With their powerful  architecture and databases, often requiring licence fees and a few dedicated GB of RAM on your web server, why wouldn‘t bigger be better? It turns out it’s not.</p>
<h2><em>We</em> got it wrong</h2>
<ul>
<li>Static HTML files are fast, no need for in-memory caching.</li>
<li>Static HTML files are secure, there&#39;s much less to try to hack.</li>
<li>Static HTML files <strong>JUST WORK</strong> on virtually any hosting environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>OK, so what are we supposed to do, go back to coding like it&#39;s 1995? Managing common HTML between pages, sitemaps and “last updated” dates manually? Forgetting about new shiny technology like SASS and LESS, JADE and HAML? Not quite. </p>
<h2>Enter the Static Site Generator</h2>
<p>A Static Site Generator is a program which generates and outputs static HTML. The idea is that all the hard work is done upfront, so the user doesn&#39;t have to do the waiting. Think of it as <em>extreme caching</em> :)</p>
<p>Many generators already exist for personal sites, blogs and reference sites etc, and are available for pretty much every language/platform you can imagine. You don‘t have to use one off the shelf, they’re pretty easy to put together (hence there being quite a few). It&#39;s also easy to get it working exactly how is best for you and your specific project.</p>
<p>I wrote a bespoke static site generator for a client earlier this year, which ingested a source atom feed and translated the data to HTML5 and RDFa using C# (wasn&#39;t my language of choice but I was constrained by internal politics, I was just happy to get the static site generator approved).</p>
<h2>This blog</h2>
<p>As a final point, this blog is static HTML. It&#39;s hosted for free on <a href="https://github.com/leecrossley/leecrossley.github.io" target="_blank">github</a> pages, with a custom domain name. I‘m writing markdown right now and using node.js to generate the HTML and CSS. Hopefully you didn’t notice the page loading.</p>
