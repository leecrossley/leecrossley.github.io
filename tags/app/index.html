    <h1 class="title"><a href="/jsonp-in-express-nodejs/">JSONP in Express/Node.js</a></h1>
  

    </header>
    <div class="entry">
      
        <h2>Express JS</h2>
<p><a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express</a> is a web application framework that facilitates the rapid and scalable development of <a href="nodejs.org">node</a> apps.</p>
<p>I‘m currently building a cross platform mobile application using cordova / phonegap for the app and express for the server. There’s a web interface, but also data can be retrieved in json format from the server by the mobile app. </p>
<h2>Getting server data with Cordova</h2>
<p>It‘s actually easy to get data from a server from within your cordova application, you don’t even need to worry about cross domain requests. Simply add this to your config.xml (which is now the default) to set up cordova correctly:</p>
<figure class="highlight lang-xml"><figcaption><span>config.xml </span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">widget</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">access</span> <span class="attribute">origin</span>=<span class="value">"*"</span> /&gt;</span>
<span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="title">widget</span>&gt;</span>
</pre></td></tr></table></figure>


<p>Then in my express node app, I do something like this:</p>
<figure class="highlight lang-javascript"><figcaption><span>Express route "/test" </span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre>app.get(<span class="string">"/test"</span>, <span class="keyword">function</span>(req, res){
    res.writeHead(<span class="number">200</span>, { <span class="string">"Content-Type"</span>: <span class="string">"application/json"</span> });
    res.write(JSON.stringify({ <span class="string">"my"</span>: <span class="string">"object"</span> }));
    res.end();
});
</pre></td></tr></table></figure>


<p>Although a little long winded in the controller route code (or action method, if you like, for you C# junkies) it works just fine when the mobile app loads the JSON data from the server using get http requests.</p>
<p>The issue is, I do my initial app development in Chrome…</p>
<h2>JSONP to the rescue</h2>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP" target="_blank">JSONP</a> is a <em>hack</em> around doing cross domain get requests but requires the cooperation of the server to succeed. Unfortunately, you can‘t request random websites data (client-side) using JSONP. We need to set some config in the express app and do things slightly differently (this isn’t very well documented).</p>
<h3>Setting up express</h3>
<p>When configuring express, you need to set an additional property:</p>
<figure class="highlight lang-javascript"><figcaption><span>Configuring express </span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre>1
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre>app.set(<span class="string">"jsonp callback"</span>, <span class="literal">true</span>);
</pre></td></tr></table></figure>


<h3>In your route code</h3>
<p>Things get simplier:</p>
<figure class="highlight lang-javascript"><figcaption><span>Express route "/test" </span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre>app.get(<span class="string">"/test"</span>, <span class="keyword">function</span>(req, res){
    res.jsonp({ <span class="string">"my"</span>: <span class="string">"object"</span> });
});
</pre></td></tr></table></figure>


<p>That‘s it, you’re done! You can happily make JSONP requests to your server.</p>
<p>Wasn‘t hard was it? Shame they don’t make it this obvious in the documentation.</p>
<p>Go and make yourself a coffee, you deserve it.</p>

        <h2>iOS 7 is coming</h2>
<p>The latest rumour is the 10th of September, in any case, it‘s coming, get your apps ready now if you haven’t already. Don&#39;t ignore this advice, devices running iOS7 running apps that were built for iOS6 (or earlier!) will stick out like a sore thumb.</p>
<h2>What&#39;s changing</h2>
<h3>The user interface</h3>
<p>One of the main changes is the look and feel and Apple want you to reflect these new guidelines in your apps. - The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/TransitionGuide/index.html" target="_blank">iOS 7 UI Transition Guide</a> (Apple login required) explains this in detail but it impacts textures, gradients, shadows, fonts, colours, navigation, buttons, arrows, keyboards, gauges, icons, actually, EVERYTHING.</p>
<h3>New APIs</h3>
<p>It&#39;s not just all fluff. There are many changes coming to APIs, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multitasking</li>
<li>UIKit</li>
<li>AirDrop</li>
<li>Sprite Kit</li>
<li>Video</li>
<li>Game Center</li>
<li>Maps</li>
</ul>
<p>There will undoubtedly be better ways to do things that your app already does. Multitasking is going to be key.</p>
<p>Who knows, there might even be <a href="/iphone-fingerprint-recognition-for-developers/">Fingerprint recognition</a>.</p>
<h2>The upshot</h2>
<p>In order for your existing apps to run properly and effectively on iOS 7, your code is likely to need changes. In some cases these changes could be extensive, depending on the complexity of the app.</p>
<p>If you don‘t upgrade your app, it’ll be 100x worse than when we made the upgrade to retina images or to the slightly larger 4&quot; screen on the iPhone 5.</p>

        <h2>The (cross-platform) mobile app developer burden</h2>
<p>Serious mobile app developers and testers need access to every mobile and tablet device they want to target. Using the various emulators and simulators will only get you 90% of the way there.</p>
<p><img src="/img/socks.png" alt="Socks"></p>
<h2>Why should I use real mobiles and tablets?</h2>
<h3>Connection types and failure</h3>
<p>If you‘re transferring data you need to ensure it works with any type of connection (whether it’s via 2G, 3G, 4G or WIFI etc) and if that connection fails, it&#39;s handled elegantly. You should also test for switching connection types. Different devices also have different connection possibilities.</p>
<h3>3rd party alerts and notifications</h3>
<p>To ensure your app responds appropriately when there&#39;s an unexpected condition, such as an incoming phone call, message, email, push notification or other type of intrusive alert.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>If you&#39;re using a simulator running on a top spec laptop, expect the performance on a mobile or tablet device to be different. The hardware and software features of a real device are never entirely replicated using an emulator. Different devices also have different performance.</p>
<h3>You got the touch</h3>
<p>Touch screen interfaces with multi-gesture support are impossible to accurately replicate on emulators and simulators. Different devices often have different touch screen interfaces.</p>
<h2>They&#39;re expensive!</h2>
<p>Physical devices are costly to acquire, once you have 20 (and that&#39;s really not a lot) you could have easily spent £10K! These devices grow old quickly and their resale value drops drastically, not that you can sell them anyway, you need them for legacy testing.</p>
<h2>Old devices</h2>
<p>It‘s not just the new, cutting edge devices you need to buy (although they are usually the most expensive), it’s the old legacy devices that often use older operating system versions you need too. I&#39;ve trawled ebay many times looking for devices that have a specific issue.</p>
<h2>Come on, keep up</h2>
<p>With the mobile and tablet market developing at an incredibly fast rate, new devices are launched regularly, so you might as well keep your bank card out of your wallet.</p>
<h2>Competitions</h2>
<p>This is a great way to get your hands on new devices. I recently won a first prize in a <a href="http://www.phonegapwpchallenge.com/" target="_blank">Windows Phone Challenge</a> that landed me a shiny new Nokia Lumia 820 (that sits nicely next to my Nokia Lumia 920).</p>
<h2>Where does this leave us?</h2>
<p>With draws full of mobile and tablets and not enough money to buy socks. Oh, but with killer apps :)</p>

        <h2>What is Hack Manchester?</h2>
<p>It‘s a 24 hour coding competition located in Manchester that started in 2012. This year (as it was last year) it’s held at the <a href="http://www.mosi.org.uk/" target="_blank">Museum of Science and Industry</a> and is on the 26th and 27th of October 2013 to kick off 2013&#39;s <a href="http://www.manchestersciencefestival.com/" target="_blank">Manchester Science Festival</a>. Props to <a href="https://twitter.com/ruby_gem" target="_blank">@ruby_gem</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/theallseeingpie" target="_blank">@theallseeingpie</a> for their hard work in organising such a great coding event.</p>
<h2>Hackathons</h2>
<p>Getting top developers working and collaborating together on innovative web and/or mobile apps is always going to produce great results, make it into a competition and the results are even better :). I used to contract at NICE in Manchester where they‘d have hack days for the dev team within the organisation to drive forward creativity and new ideas. It’s a fantastic way to work and there should be more of them.</p>
<h2>Winning in 2012</h2>
<p>If you know me, I‘ve probably mentioned once or twice (more?) about winning the 2012 Thoughtworks Hack Manchester challenge. My team developed an interactive “What’s On” app for the Museum of Science and Industry. The app had interactive map animations, the ability to find your current location within any of the museums buildings and showcased Google Calendar powered events. Users of the app were able to find events occurring at locations around the museum and create a personal “day planner”. There&#39;s a <a href="http://vimeo.com/52477912" target="_blank">video here</a> if you&#39;re interested.</p>
<h2>The team is back</h2>
<p>I&#39;m not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_Back...#Bring_Back...The_A-Team" target="_blank">Justin Lee Collins</a> but I&#39;ve brought the team back together. <a href="https://twitter.com/lee_crossley" target="_blank">Myself</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/edhiley" target="_blank">@edhiley</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ryansroberts" target="_blank">@ryansroberts</a> have thrown some preliminary ideas in the pot and we&#39;re waiting for all the sponsor APIs to be announced.</p>
<h2>Lessons learnt</h2>
<p>We learnt some things from last year that I&#39;m happy to share with you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Idea planning.</strong> Don&#39;t do any <em>coding</em> before the day (it‘s against the rules) but having some ideas of what you’re going to code and reading any documentation before hand will save you time (and fighting) on the day.</li>
<li><strong>Have your tool chain / dev environment ready.</strong> Last year <em>one of our team members</em> tried to download xcode right at the start of the coding session.</li>
<li><strong>Be realistic about what you&#39;re building.</strong> Time flies, it‘ll be 4am before you know it and you don’t want to add extra stress to the caffeine + no sleep equation. Make sure you&#39;re realistic about what you can achieve, review this constantly and have contingency plans.</li>
<li><strong>Know the sponsors.</strong> If you‘re using a sponsors API, it’s crucial that you have a relationship with them if you‘re going to need help. It’ll save you time and they‘ll be excited to see what you’re doing.</li>
<li><strong>Have breaks and enjoy it.</strong> We found that coming back to things after a short break made us more productive. Fortunately the nice guys at Hack Manchester organise food and snacks etc for you. It‘s your free time, take the time to meet other people and find out what they’re up to. I always meet great people at hack events.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tickets</h2>
<p>Tickets for Hack Manchester 2013 went <a href="http://hackmanchester.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">on sale yesterday</a> and were selling pretty fast. I scooped up 3 tickets for my team, if you missed your chance to get yours there will be other opportunities, so I suggest following <a href="https://twitter.com/HackManchester" target="_blank">@HackManchester</a> on twitter to find out when the next wave will be released.</p>
<h2>Shhhh</h2>
<p>I‘ll probably not be discussing any preliminary hack ideas here, but I like Guinness and if you’re around Manchester…</p>

        <h2>The new iPhone fingerprint recognition API</h2>
<p>As a mobile app developer, I follow new mobile technologies very closely. You&#39;ve probably noticed yourself an abundance of rumours on various sites about the upcoming “Fingerprint Recognition” seen in the new beta version of iOS7. This suggests the hardware capabilities will be available on the next version of the iPhone (iPhone 5S?).</p>
<p>The “BiometricKitUI” directory can be found in the “Accessibility Bundles” and judging by the small amount of documentation, implies that the fingerprint sensor will be part of the home button.</p>
<p><img src="/img/fingerprint-iphone.png" alt="Fingerprint scanning on iPhone"></p>
<h2>Will it be available to app developers?</h2>
<p>This is what I want to know :) I can see several usages for the core system, such as a login alternative to swipe and pin, verification for app store purchases, parental control, restricted apps and maybe even user profiles, although apple have always seemed to push for everyone having their own device for some reason ;).</p>
<h2>When will we know?</h2>
<p>I‘m sure app developers at the top banks know, with this being a possible security option for them. I’m going to ask some of my tweeps today and will post an update when I find out.</p>
<p>It&#39;s strongly believed that the new iPhone will be available on the 10th of September 2013, I also imagine the iOS7 release to be scheduled for around this time, as in past years.</p>
<h2>Will it be any good?</h2>
<p>I‘ve had laptops (a while ago) with fingerprint recognition, which was quickly disabled. I’ve found it to be unreliable and a nuisance. Will Apple‘s implementation and hardware be better? Having just acquired “AuthenTec” for $356 million in July 2012 you’d like to hope so. If not, I‘m sure they’ll tell us we&#39;re “holding it wrong” :)</p>
<h2>“i”Lee, is this blog going to be Apple-y?</h2>
<p>No. Not at all (actually being serious here). Although MacBook Pros are the best. Please don&#39;t give them fingerprint recognition.</p>
