        <h2>Manc JS</h2>
<p>Last night I attended my first <a href="http://mancjs.com/" target="_blank">Manc JS</a>. If you know me, you know that I like a <a href="/road-to-hack-manchester/">good hack</a> and the “Rock Paper Scissors Bots” night lived up to expectations. Props to <a href="https://twitter.com/martinrue" target="_blank">@martinrue</a>.</p>
<h2>The game</h2>
<p>Each bot played 50 “hands” against each of the other bots. Unlike traditional Rock Paper Scissors, two new entities were introduced:</p>
<ul>
<li>“dynamite”, which beats paper, scissors and rock <em>but can only be used a maximum of 5 times per game</em></li>
<li>“water (balloon)”, which beats dynamite only and <em>can be used any number of times</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Bots were comprised of at least 3 functions, “init”, “play” and “result”, which were called by the server running the bots against each other.</p>
<h2>My approach</h2>
<p>Even the most complex of strategies would struggle to beat a truly random opponent, although the “dynamite” hand mitigated this slightly. Nevertheless, I didn‘t want to write any random code, it’s way less fun and more unpredictable. I decided it would be much better to consistently secure the top positions on the leaderboard as opposed to go for a random <strong>boom or bust</strong> or <strong>hit and hope</strong>, we are programmers after all.</p>
<h3>Sub-bots</h3>
<p>Although we were only allowed to play one hand for each turn, my approach was to create multiple sub-bots that would play silently each time:</p>
<figure class="highlight lang-javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="comment">// Example sub-bot that always plays "paper"</span>
bot.paperBot = (<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="params">()</span> {</span>
    <span class="keyword">var</span> bot = {};
    
    bot.winners = <span class="number">0</span>;
    bot.lastPlay = <span class="string">""</span>;
    
    bot.nextPlay = <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="params">()</span> {</span>
        <span class="keyword">var</span> play = <span class="string">"paper"</span>;
        bot.lastPlay = play;
        <span class="keyword">return</span> play;
    };

    <span class="keyword">return</span> bot;
})();
</pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>After the result of each hand was returned by the server, the outcome of whether each sub-bot would have won was recorded. Over the 50 hands, using a greedy approach, the sub-bot that was played was the one with the most amount of winners.</p>
<p>Given more time and more sub-bots this approach would have become slightly more robust.</p>
<h3>We‘re gonna light it up, like it’s dynamite</h3>
<p>I played with a few ideas for dynamite, it appeared quite quickly that most bots played dynamite straight after a draw (as points were carried), so initially I played water straight after a draw then dynamite straight after that. This wasn&#39;t a good strategy, as water is a weak hand.</p>
<p>The approach I rested on was to not ever bother playing water, ever, and to play dynamite (if any was remaining) 2 hands after a draw, as this appeared to be the least likely time another bot would play it :)</p>
<p>Obviously, even when dynamite was played, the outcome of whether each sub-bot would have won was still recorded.</p>
<h2>Tests</h2>
<p>My code was ugly, but it was linted and had some noddy jasmine tests (using grunt and plugins) for my own sanity and so not to waste too many trial runs.</p>
<figure class="highlight lang-javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre>1

</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="comment">// Example of my noddy tests</span>
it(<span class="string">"should init and set opponent"</span>, <span class="keyword">function</span>() {
    init(<span class="string">"test"</span>);
    expect(bot.opponent).toEqual(<span class="string">"test"</span>);
});

it(<span class="string">"should use paper as the first play"</span>, <span class="keyword">function</span>() {
    <span class="comment">// First play always paper, as all bots have 0 wins</span>
    <span class="comment">// NB: Should randomise the first bot :)</span>
    expect(play()).toEqual(<span class="string">"paper"</span>);
});

it(<span class="string">"should win the first hand against rock and increment winning tally"</span>, <span class="keyword">function</span>() {
    result({ test: <span class="string">"rock"</span>, lee: <span class="string">"paper"</span>, winner: <span class="string">"lee"</span>, draw: <span class="literal">false</span> });
    expect(bot.paperBot.winners).toEqual(<span class="number">1</span>);
});
</pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h2>Result</h2>
<p>Meh, I came 2nd. Not bad out of 17 I guess ;)</p>
<p>I wish we had more time to play. Maybe this could become an ongoing challenge..?</p>

        <h2>What is Hack Manchester?</h2>
<p>It‘s a 24 hour coding competition located in Manchester that started in 2012. This year (as it was last year) it’s held at the <a href="http://www.mosi.org.uk/" target="_blank">Museum of Science and Industry</a> and is on the 26th and 27th of October 2013 to kick off 2013&#39;s <a href="http://www.manchestersciencefestival.com/" target="_blank">Manchester Science Festival</a>. Props to <a href="https://twitter.com/ruby_gem" target="_blank">@ruby_gem</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/theallseeingpie" target="_blank">@theallseeingpie</a> for their hard work in organising such a great coding event.</p>
<h2>Hackathons</h2>
<p>Getting top developers working and collaborating together on innovative web and/or mobile apps is always going to produce great results, make it into a competition and the results are even better :). I used to contract at NICE in Manchester where they‘d have hack days for the dev team within the organisation to drive forward creativity and new ideas. It’s a fantastic way to work and there should be more of them.</p>
<h2>Winning in 2012</h2>
<p>If you know me, I‘ve probably mentioned once or twice (more?) about winning the 2012 Thoughtworks Hack Manchester challenge. My team developed an interactive “What’s On” app for the Museum of Science and Industry. The app had interactive map animations, the ability to find your current location within any of the museums buildings and showcased Google Calendar powered events. Users of the app were able to find events occurring at locations around the museum and create a personal “day planner”. There&#39;s a <a href="http://vimeo.com/52477912" target="_blank">video here</a> if you&#39;re interested.</p>
<h2>The team is back</h2>
<p>I&#39;m not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_Back...#Bring_Back...The_A-Team" target="_blank">Justin Lee Collins</a> but I&#39;ve brought the team back together. <a href="https://twitter.com/lee_crossley" target="_blank">Myself</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/edhiley" target="_blank">@edhiley</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ryansroberts" target="_blank">@ryansroberts</a> have thrown some preliminary ideas in the pot and we&#39;re waiting for all the sponsor APIs to be announced.</p>
<h2>Lessons learnt</h2>
<p>We learnt some things from last year that I&#39;m happy to share with you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Idea planning.</strong> Don&#39;t do any <em>coding</em> before the day (it‘s against the rules) but having some ideas of what you’re going to code and reading any documentation before hand will save you time (and fighting) on the day.</li>
<li><strong>Have your tool chain / dev environment ready.</strong> Last year <em>one of our team members</em> tried to download xcode right at the start of the coding session.</li>
<li><strong>Be realistic about what you&#39;re building.</strong> Time flies, it‘ll be 4am before you know it and you don’t want to add extra stress to the caffeine + no sleep equation. Make sure you&#39;re realistic about what you can achieve, review this constantly and have contingency plans.</li>
<li><strong>Know the sponsors.</strong> If you‘re using a sponsors API, it’s crucial that you have a relationship with them if you‘re going to need help. It’ll save you time and they‘ll be excited to see what you’re doing.</li>
<li><strong>Have breaks and enjoy it.</strong> We found that coming back to things after a short break made us more productive. Fortunately the nice guys at Hack Manchester organise food and snacks etc for you. It‘s your free time, take the time to meet other people and find out what they’re up to. I always meet great people at hack events.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tickets</h2>
<p>Tickets for Hack Manchester 2013 went <a href="http://hackmanchester.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">on sale yesterday</a> and were selling pretty fast. I scooped up 3 tickets for my team, if you missed your chance to get yours there will be other opportunities, so I suggest following <a href="https://twitter.com/HackManchester" target="_blank">@HackManchester</a> on twitter to find out when the next wave will be released.</p>
<h2>Shhhh</h2>
<p>I‘ll probably not be discussing any preliminary hack ideas here, but I like Guinness and if you’re around Manchester…</p>
