        <h2>Domain names to buy</h2>
<p>Today I have listed some domain names to buy, including “domainnamestobuy.com” (should really stick them on there!). I was prompted to have this spring clean as I attempt to consolidate hosting providers and domain name registrars over the coming months.</p>
<h2>Current list</h2>
<p>The following domain names are now for sale on <a href="http://www.sedo.co.uk/main.php3?language=e&amp;partnerid=315645" target="_blank">sedo</a> (at the time of writing this some 1 or 2 listings are still pending):</p>
<ul>
<li>backingmusic.com (backing music, bought for $2,325 10 years ago)</li>
<li>bidzer.co.uk (a possible bidding auction site)</li>
<li>domainnamestobuy.com (to sell domain names)</li>
<li>bookinbritain.com (hotel / room booking)</li>
<li>bookinbritain.co.uk (hotel / room booking)</li>
<li>bookingbritain.com (hotel / room booking)</li>
<li>bookingbritain.co.uk (hotel / room booking)</li>
<li>guesthousenetwork.co.uk (guest house booking)</li>
<li>ifindrooms.com (hotel / room booking)</li>
<li>ifindrooms.co.uk (hotel / room booking)</li>
<li>myweightapp.com (weight app)</li>
<li>myweightapp.co.uk (weight app)</li>
<li>webdevelopmentmanchester.com (local web development)</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#39;s difficult to price a domain, but everything is negotiable, especially to my blog readers :) Make me an offer.</p>
<p>Most of the domain names are hotel booking based, iFindRooms would also make a pretty good app name.</p>

        <h2>The PhoneGap-Gap</h2>
<p>Having a central registry or repository for all Cordova / PhoneGap plugins (both core and 3rd party) seems like an obvious thing to have. Unfortunately, no-one had <em>actually done it</em>.</p>
<p>As a Cordova developer, I did often wonder while writing a plugin if someone else had already written one.</p>
<blockquote>&quot;<strong>If only there was a place I could search for plugins and instantly find out what platforms and engines they support.</strong>&quot;</blockquote>

<h2>Making dreams come true</h2>
<p>Failing that, a Plugin Registry for Cordova / PhoneGap. That&#39;s right, <em>I&#39;ve done it</em>, hence there not being a blog post for a couple of days. Busy busy busy.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.plugreg.com" target="_blank">PlugReg</a></h3>
<p>PlugReg is written using nodejs, of course. Here are some of the preliminary features that have been implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Submit</strong>. Submit plugins automagically with a GitHub url</li>
<li><strong>Search</strong>. Search on plugin name and keywords</li>
<li><strong>Authors List</strong>. List of all plugin authors, with how many plugins and a total count</li>
<li><strong>Author Page</strong>. List of all plugins by an author (and avatar), and a link to their GitHub</li>
<li><strong>Plugins List</strong>. List of all plugins and a total count</li>
<li><strong>Plugin Details</strong>. Details such as plugin description, supported platforms, engines, keyword tags, link to GitHub and installation instructions</li>
<li><strong>Latest Plugins</strong>. List of the latest plugins added</li>
</ul>
<h2>Suggestions, comments and feedback</h2>
<p>All welcome, one thing I&#39;m wondering if might be helpful for the site is user ratings and possibly user comments? What do you guys think?</p>
<p>Please add your own plugins or any plugins you have used.</p>

        <h2>What has “Walter White” got to do with actual colours and HTML?</h2>
<p>Breaking Bad is a bit of a hot topic at the moment (I‘m a fan myself) but you’re probably thinking <strong>where on earth is he going with this, “Walter White” isn&#39;t a valid colour</strong>. Let me explain before you think I&#39;ve gone mad.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<figure class="highlight lang-html"><figcaption><span>Walter White snippet </span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre>1
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">font</span> <span class="attribute">color</span>=<span class="value">"Walter White"</span>&gt;</span>Walter White<span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="title">font</span>&gt;</span>
</pre></td></tr></table></figure>


<p>The above code snippet will actually colour the text “Walter White”, in a Breaking Bad green, automatically.</p>
<p>Don‘t believe me? Here’s a <a href="http://codepen.io/leecrossley/pen/DaLdt" target="_blank">live demo</a>. Apologies for the use of a font tag.</p>
<h2>What is going on here?!</h2>
<p>It does seem crazy but fortunately there is some <strong>science</strong> behind it :)</p>
<h3>The cooking process</h3>
<ol>
<li>Replace all invalid hexadecimal characters with “0”</li>
<li>Divide all hexadecimal characters into 3 even groups (pad if necessary)</li>
<li>Take the first 2 hexadecimal characters from each group</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Et voilà!</strong></p>
<p>No? Let&#39;s step through the example.</p>
<ol>
<li>“Walter White” becomes “0a00e000000e” when replacing invalid hexadecimal characters with “0”</li>
<li>“0a00e000000e” is 12 characters long, so dividing into 3 groups gives “0a00 e000 000e”</li>
<li>Taking the first 2 hexadecimal characters from each group in “0a00 e000 000e” produces “0a e0 00”</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>“Walter White” = “#0ae000”</strong></p>
<p>I would have expected it to be blue, but I‘m guessing the process isn’t 100% pure :)</p>

    <div class="entry">
      
        <h2>Using JavaScript to change the page url without reloading</h2>
<p>Not many web developers know but it&#39;s possible to <strong>completely</strong> change the relative url of a webpage without reloading or refreshing the page. In fact, the browser won‘t even try to get the new url and it doesn’t matter if it doesn&#39;t exist on the server.</p>
<p>I‘m not talking about just changing “the bit after the hash (#)” I’m referring to the entire relative url. I‘m also not talking about iFrames either - this solution isn’t a hack, it&#39;s a feature of all modern browsers (Chrome, Safari, FF(4+), and IE(10+)).</p>
<p><img src="/img/google-chrome.png" alt="Google Chrome"></p>
<h2>How it&#39;s done</h2>
<p>HTML5 introduced the concepts of pushState, replaceState and the onpopstate event. These allow programatic modification of the browsers history.</p>
<h3>The history.pushState() function</h3>
<p>This changes the HTTP header referrer for future XMLHttpRequests. It takes three arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>State</strong> argument (<em>object</em>). This JavaScript object is used when the onpopstate event is fired (explained below).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Title</strong> argument (<em>string</em>). This string is currently used as an internal reference to the title of the page being loaded. Browsers haven&#39;t implemented the document title change based on this parameter, although you can do it manually if required (document.title = “your title”).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Url</strong> argument (<em>string</em>). This string is the new url to be “loaded” into the address bar. The url must be relative, or at least have the same origin as the current url. As mentioned above, the browser won‘t try to get the new url and it doesn’t matter if it doesn&#39;t exist on the server.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<figure class="highlight lang-javascript"><figcaption><span>history.pushState() example </span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">var</span> state = {
  <span class="string">"canBeAnything"</span>: <span class="literal">true</span>
};
history.pushState(state, <span class="string">"New Title"</span>, <span class="string">"/new-page"</span>);
expect(history.state).toEqual(state);
</pre></td></tr></table></figure>


<p>The above example will update the url in the address bar to be “/new-page” without a refreshing or reloading the page. It also updates the browser history in the same way you would expect window.location to.</p>
<h3>The history.replaceState() function</h3>
<p>Behaves exactly the same as the history.pushState() function, with the exception of not updating the browser history. To be honest, I&#39;ve never bothered to use this one.</p>
<h3>The onpopstate event</h3>
<p>This is fired every time one of the above 2 functions are called and essentially updates the history.state object. You can therefore access the current page state object (the first argument passed to pushState() or replaceState()) at any time using history.state. If neither function has yet been called, history.state is likely to be null.</p>
<h2>Back to the future</h2>
<p>When using the history.pushState() function, as I mentioned, the browser history is updated. This allows you to use history.forward() and history.back() in the usual way, as well as the history forward and back buttons on the browser. history.length is also kept in sync so you can use history.go(n) too.</p>
<h2>Usages</h2>
<p>The first place I think I saw this being used was a couple of years ago on Github and it works really well. I implemented something for a client where a whole article was loaded to the page, but only sections were shown at a time (the reason being Google preferred to see the whole RDFa document at once and it was created using a bespoke <a href="/static-site-generators/">static site generator</a>). I used location hashes to swap out the visible sections but could have easily used the history.pushState() function and fallen back to the location hashes for older browsers.</p>
<p>Have fun relocating.</p>

        <h2>Get more twitter retweets and favourites</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.tweetthen.com/" target="_blank">TweetThen</a> allows you to calculate the optimal day and time for you to tweet, based on retweets and favourites your tweets have had in the past.</p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>Visit <a href="http://www.tweetthen.com/" target="_blank">TweetThen</a> and authorise the website to access your twitter account. <strong>That&#39;s it!</strong> You&#39;ll automatically be displayed a punch card style chart showing you the days and times when your past tweets were favourited or retweeted (note that it uses the time of your original tweet).</p>
<h2>Why should I bother?</h2>
<p>Whether you&#39;re an individual or a company, you tweet because you want people to read it and engage with it. If you have an important tweet, you want to get the maximum possible exposure.</p>
<p>Twitter is global and users/followers are from various timezones, so your optimal post time may not be what you think. Also, everyones followers are different, TweetThen tailors your date and times directly to your twitter account.</p>
<h2>Is this a unique idea?</h2>
<p>I‘ve found a couple of others doing similar things. One service is free but doesn’t work - at all, and the other costs $4.99 per request! <strong>TweetThen is currently 100% free.</strong></p>
<h2>Who wrote it?</h2>
<p>If you‘ve not guessed by now, it’s a little pet project I started yesterday. It&#39;s built using <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">node.js</a> and uses my <a href="https://github.com/leecrossley/functional-js" target="_blank">functional.js library</a>. I wanted to explore some real world usages of functional.js and also get to grips with the twitter v1.1 API.</p>
<h2>Alpha?</h2>
<p>It‘s is a first iteration prototype and therefore may not perform as intended and issues are possible. I hope to have a beta release soon with an improved assessment algorithm. I’m a strong believer in always developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) initially, for fast and quantitative market testing. </p>
<p>If you have any suggestions or improvements, just drop me a tweet but make sure you use TweetThen first, so you know when&#39;s best to do it :)</p>

        <h2>What is Hack Manchester?</h2>
<p>It‘s a 24 hour coding competition located in Manchester that started in 2012. This year (as it was last year) it’s held at the <a href="http://www.mosi.org.uk/" target="_blank">Museum of Science and Industry</a> and is on the 26th and 27th of October 2013 to kick off 2013&#39;s <a href="http://www.manchestersciencefestival.com/" target="_blank">Manchester Science Festival</a>. Props to <a href="https://twitter.com/ruby_gem" target="_blank">@ruby_gem</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/theallseeingpie" target="_blank">@theallseeingpie</a> for their hard work in organising such a great coding event.</p>
<h2>Hackathons</h2>
<p>Getting top developers working and collaborating together on innovative web and/or mobile apps is always going to produce great results, make it into a competition and the results are even better :). I used to contract at NICE in Manchester where they‘d have hack days for the dev team within the organisation to drive forward creativity and new ideas. It’s a fantastic way to work and there should be more of them.</p>
<h2>Winning in 2012</h2>
<p>If you know me, I‘ve probably mentioned once or twice (more?) about winning the 2012 Thoughtworks Hack Manchester challenge. My team developed an interactive “What’s On” app for the Museum of Science and Industry. The app had interactive map animations, the ability to find your current location within any of the museums buildings and showcased Google Calendar powered events. Users of the app were able to find events occurring at locations around the museum and create a personal “day planner”. There&#39;s a <a href="http://vimeo.com/52477912" target="_blank">video here</a> if you&#39;re interested.</p>
<h2>The team is back</h2>
<p>I&#39;m not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_Back...#Bring_Back...The_A-Team" target="_blank">Justin Lee Collins</a> but I&#39;ve brought the team back together. <a href="https://twitter.com/lee_crossley" target="_blank">Myself</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/edhiley" target="_blank">@edhiley</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ryansroberts" target="_blank">@ryansroberts</a> have thrown some preliminary ideas in the pot and we&#39;re waiting for all the sponsor APIs to be announced.</p>
<h2>Lessons learnt</h2>
<p>We learnt some things from last year that I&#39;m happy to share with you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Idea planning.</strong> Don&#39;t do any <em>coding</em> before the day (it‘s against the rules) but having some ideas of what you’re going to code and reading any documentation before hand will save you time (and fighting) on the day.</li>
<li><strong>Have your tool chain / dev environment ready.</strong> Last year <em>one of our team members</em> tried to download xcode right at the start of the coding session.</li>
<li><strong>Be realistic about what you&#39;re building.</strong> Time flies, it‘ll be 4am before you know it and you don’t want to add extra stress to the caffeine + no sleep equation. Make sure you&#39;re realistic about what you can achieve, review this constantly and have contingency plans.</li>
<li><strong>Know the sponsors.</strong> If you‘re using a sponsors API, it’s crucial that you have a relationship with them if you‘re going to need help. It’ll save you time and they‘ll be excited to see what you’re doing.</li>
<li><strong>Have breaks and enjoy it.</strong> We found that coming back to things after a short break made us more productive. Fortunately the nice guys at Hack Manchester organise food and snacks etc for you. It‘s your free time, take the time to meet other people and find out what they’re up to. I always meet great people at hack events.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tickets</h2>
<p>Tickets for Hack Manchester 2013 went <a href="http://hackmanchester.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">on sale yesterday</a> and were selling pretty fast. I scooped up 3 tickets for my team, if you missed your chance to get yours there will be other opportunities, so I suggest following <a href="https://twitter.com/HackManchester" target="_blank">@HackManchester</a> on twitter to find out when the next wave will be released.</p>
<h2>Shhhh</h2>
<p>I‘ll probably not be discussing any preliminary hack ideas here, but I like Guinness and if you’re around Manchester…</p>

    <div class="entry">
      
        <h2>Why?</h2>
<p>The short of it - speeding up your website is a great thing to do all round. It improves visitor experience, retention, and conversions. With data mobile browsing becoming increasingly popular, saving those extra few KB to download can make a big difference to your users.</p>
<p>On April 9th 2010 <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.co.uk/2010/04/using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking.html" target="_blank">Google officially announced</a> the inclusion of a new “signal” in their search ranking algorithms. You guessed it, page speed. So it goes without saying that using Google PageSpeed on your site could also improve your search engine rankings.</p>
<h2>It&#39;s free?</h2>
<p>Yes and no, Google are in it for the €€€ in their Irish pocket. The Google PageSpeed <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights" target="_blank">Insights</a> are currently (and I imagine will always be) free, but the Google PageSpeed <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/service" target="_blank">Service</a> is only a limited free trial. Lose <em>wait</em> that way and the pounds are sure to drop off.</p>
<h2>Insights vs Service</h2>
<p>The Insights allow Google to analyse your website and generate suggestions to help make it faster. The PageSpeed score is any number up to 100 (the higher the better, but Google have suggested you should aim for 85 and above). They also colour code suggestions to help you see which changes will give you the highest impact and potentially quick wins (they&#39;re red). Their current suggestions are mainly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eliminate external render-blocking Javascript and CSS</li>
<li>Avoid landing page redirects</li>
<li>Leverage browser caching</li>
<li>Enable compression</li>
<li>Reduce server response time to &lt; 200ms</li>
<li>Minify HTML, CSS and JavaScript</li>
<li>Optimise images</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/img/response-speed.png" alt="200ms Response"></p>
<p>Some of the Insights guidance is (probably intentionally) tough to follow and may also be constrained by the technology or hosting you&#39;re using. Do not fear, Google is here, with their quick and easy, automated service. Alternatively, you could just use a <a href="http://ilee.co.uk/static-site-generators/">Static Site Generator</a> with some sensible hosting. I&#39;ll probably go over some of the more tricky suggestions at a later date.</p>
<h2>Don&#39;t just do it once</h2>
<p>Do it every night if you can - and make sure you‘re always on top. As for PageSpeed Insights, because the web is fast paced and continually evolving, they’re iterative. Just like the main search algorithm, expect the PageSpeed algorithm and suggestions to change frequently.</p>
<h2>This blog</h2>
<p>Bragging time again. This site currently (at the time of writing) has a desktop PageSpeed score of 97/100. That‘s better than Facebook, Twitter, ebay etc and equal to Google’s own score for Google.com. Yey for me.</p>

        <h2>The world is turning flat</h2>
<p>Print designers that design for the web are stepping close to the edge.</p>
<p><img src="/img/flat-world.png" alt="The world is flat"></p>
<h2>This blog</h2>
<p>I&#39;m not a designer (this is where anyone that has worked with me recently will try to wind me up). <strong>I&#39;m not a designer</strong>, but this blog looks OK, right? It‘s simple, no shadows, no gradients and no interface images (at all, the icons are a font). 99% of the time, that’s what users want, something that‘s easy to use and understand. It loads quickly too, but that’s a discussion for another day.</p>
<h2>The “Flat UI” / “Metro” era</h2>
<p>Companies and organisations have started to publish their own design guidelines and principles, with a very common theme. Less is more. Here are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples" target="_blank">GOV UK design principles</a> makes it clear that they are be building simple and informative digital services, not websites.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://developer.windowsphone.com/en-us/design/principles" target="_blank">Windows Phone design principles</a> outlines their philosophy as clean, uncluttered screens that operate quickly.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/TransitionGuide/index.html" target="_blank">iOS 7 UI Transition Guide</a> (Apple login required) emphasises that the UI should helps users understand and interact with the content and never compete with it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By now you‘ve probably realised I’m not just talking about the web, I&#39;m talking about mobile apps too.</p>
<h2>But what about colours?</h2>
<p><strong>Science my friend</strong>. There are tons of colour scheme generators <a href="http://colorschemedesigner.com/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://kuler.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/" target="_blank">here</a>, if you&#39;re too lazy to <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=colour+scheme+generators" target="_blank">Google it</a>. Or you can use the colour scheme from <a href="http://flatuicolors.com/" target="_blank">Flat UI</a>, which this blog uses. You don‘t need to worry about gradient colours or shadow colours and depth (sorry if that’s the wrong terminology, <strong>I&#39;m not a designer</strong> remember).</p>
<h2>Good developers</h2>
<p>A good developer that&#39;s worth their salt should be able to source any required digital assets, generate a colour scheme and produce a series of quick prototypes. The prototype layouts should be iterated based on real user feedback, not from endless design meetings about what people might want something to look like, which produces pointless psds or pdfs.</p>
<h2>Where does this leave print designers?</h2>
<p>People still print brochures and leaflets (for some reason). Icon fonts and vector based images are even more important than ever and this is something that print designers should be comfortable in producing.</p>

        <h2>You may not have noticed but static HTML is taking back the web</h2>
<p>We all thought the days of static HTML websites were long gone when almighty server-side content management systems developed. With their powerful  architecture and databases, often requiring licence fees and a few dedicated GB of RAM on your web server, why wouldn‘t bigger be better? It turns out it’s not.</p>
<h2><em>We</em> got it wrong</h2>
<ul>
<li>Static HTML files are fast, no need for in-memory caching.</li>
<li>Static HTML files are secure, there&#39;s much less to try to hack.</li>
<li>Static HTML files <strong>JUST WORK</strong> on virtually any hosting environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>OK, so what are we supposed to do, go back to coding like it&#39;s 1995? Managing common HTML between pages, sitemaps and “last updated” dates manually? Forgetting about new shiny technology like SASS and LESS, JADE and HAML? Not quite. </p>
<h2>Enter the Static Site Generator</h2>
<p>A Static Site Generator is a program which generates and outputs static HTML. The idea is that all the hard work is done upfront, so the user doesn&#39;t have to do the waiting. Think of it as <em>extreme caching</em> :)</p>
<p>Many generators already exist for personal sites, blogs and reference sites etc, and are available for pretty much every language/platform you can imagine. You don‘t have to use one off the shelf, they’re pretty easy to put together (hence there being quite a few). It&#39;s also easy to get it working exactly how is best for you and your specific project.</p>
<p>I wrote a bespoke static site generator for a client earlier this year, which ingested a source atom feed and translated the data to HTML5 and RDFa using C# (wasn&#39;t my language of choice but I was constrained by internal politics, I was just happy to get the static site generator approved).</p>
<h2>This blog</h2>
<p>As a final point, this blog is static HTML. It&#39;s hosted for free on <a href="https://github.com/leecrossley/leecrossley.github.io" target="_blank">github</a> pages, with a custom domain name. I‘m writing markdown right now and using node.js to generate the HTML and CSS. Hopefully you didn’t notice the page loading.</p>
